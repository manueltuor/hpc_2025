Notes for table 1:

  This table shows functions that have significant exclusive sample
    hits, averaged across ranks.
  For further explanation, use:  pat_report -v -O samp_profile ...

Observation:  MPI utilization

    No suggestions were made because each node has only one rank.


Notes for table 3:

  This table shows memory traffic for numa nodes, taking for each numa
    node the maximum value across nodes. It also shows the balance in
    memory traffic by showing the top 3 and bottom 3 node values.
  For further explanation, use:  pat_report -v -O mem_bw ...

Notes for table 4:

  This table shows energy and power usage for the nodes with the
    maximum, mean, and minimum usage, as well as the sum of usage over
    all nodes.
    Energy and power for accelerators is also shown, if available.
  For further explanation, use:  pat_report -v -O program_energy ...
